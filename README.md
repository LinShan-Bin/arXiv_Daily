| **[InsTaG: Learning Personalized 3D Talking Head from Few-Second Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20387v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite exhibiting impressive performance in synthesizing lifelike personalized 3D talking heads, prevailing methods based on radiance fields suffer from high demands for training data and time for each new identity. This paper introduces InsTaG, a 3D talking head synthesis framework that allows a fast learning of realistic personalized 3D talking head from few training data. Built upon a lightweight 3DGS person-specific synthesizer with universal motion priors, InsTaG achieves high-quality and fast adaptation while preserving high-level personalization and efficiency. As preparation, we first propose an Identity-Free Pre-training strategy that enables the pre-training of the person-specific model and encourages the collection of universal motion priors from long-video data corpus. To fully exploit the universal motion priors to learn an unseen new identity, we then present a Motion-Aligned Adaptation strategy to adaptively align the target head to the pre-trained field, and constrain a robust dynamic head structure under few training data. Experiments demonstrate our outstanding performance and efficiency under various data scenarios to render high-quality personalized talking heads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025.

| **[Tight Inversion: Image-Conditioned Inversion for Real Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20376v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models offer powerful image editing capabilities. To edit real images, many methods rely on the inversion of the image into Gaussian noise. A common approach to invert an image is to gradually add noise to the image, where the noise is determined by reversing the sampling equation. This process has an inherent tradeoff between reconstruction and editability, limiting the editing of challenging images such as highly-detailed ones. Recognizing the reliance of text-to-image models inversion on a text condition, this work explores the importance of the condition choice. We show that a condition that precisely aligns with the input image significantly improves the inversion quality. Based on our findings, we introduce Tight Inversion, an inversion method that utilizes the most possible precise condition -- the input image itself. This tight condition narrows the distribution of the model's output and enhances both reconstruction and editability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when combined with existing inversion methods through extensive experiments, evaluating the reconstruction accuracy as well as the integration with various editing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://tight-inversion.github.io</p></details> | 论文指出文本到图像扩散模型虽有强大编辑能力，但现有图像反转方法在重建与可编辑性间有取舍。该研究发现精确匹配输入图像的条件可提升反转质量，据此提出Tight Inversion方法，实验证明其与现有方法结合的有效性。  |

| **[Point Policy: Unifying Observations and Actions with Key Points for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20391v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building robotic agents capable of operating across diverse environments and object types remains a significant challenge, often requiring extensive data collection. This is particularly restrictive in robotics, where each data point must be physically executed in the real world. Consequently, there is a critical need for alternative data sources for robotics and frameworks that enable learning from such data. In this work, we present Point Policy, a new method for learning robot policies exclusively from offline human demonstration videos and without any teleoperation data. Point Policy leverages state-of-the-art vision models and policy architectures to translate human hand poses into robot poses while capturing object states through semantically meaningful key points. This approach yields a morphology-agnostic representation that facilitates effective policy learning. Our experiments on 8 real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 75% absolute improvement over prior works when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further, Point Policy exhibits a 74% gain across tasks for novel object instances and is robust to significant background clutter. Videos of the robot are best viewed at https://point-policy.github.io/.</p></details> |  | 论文提出Point Policy方法，能仅从离线人类示范视频学习机器人策略，无需遥操作数据。利用视觉模型和策略架构，通过关键点捕捉物体状态，统一观察与行动，形态无关表示助于有效学习，实验效果显著优于 prior works。  |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

| **[Waves and symbols in neuromorphic hardware: from analog signal processing to digital computing on the same computational substrate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20381v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural systems use the same underlying computational substrate to carry out analog filtering and signal processing operations, as well as discrete symbol manipulation and digital computation. Inspired by the computational principles of canonical cortical microcircuits, we propose a framework for using recurrent spiking neural networks to seamlessly and robustly switch between analog signal processing and categorical and discrete computation. We provide theoretical analysis and practical neural network design tools to formally determine the conditions for inducing this switch. We demonstrate the robustness of this framework experimentally with hardware soft Winner-Take-All and mixed-feedback recurrent spiking neural networks, implemented by appropriately configuring the analog neuron and synapse circuits of a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor chip.</p></details> |  | 受皮层微电路计算原理启发，提出用递归脉冲神经网络在模拟信号处理与分类离散计算间无缝切换的框架，提供理论分析与设计工具，通过硬件实验证明该框架的鲁棒性。  |
| **[The Role of Tactile Sensing for Learning Reach and Grasp](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20367v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stable and robust robotic grasping is essential for current and future robot applications. In recent works, the use of large datasets and supervised learning has enhanced speed and precision in antipodal grasping. However, these methods struggle with perception and calibration errors due to large planning horizons. To obtain more robust and reactive grasping motions, leveraging reinforcement learning combined with tactile sensing is a promising direction. Yet, there is no systematic evaluation of how the complexity of force-based tactile sensing affects the learning behavior for grasping tasks. This paper compares various tactile and environmental setups using two model-free reinforcement learning approaches for antipodal grasping. Our findings suggest that under imperfect visual perception, various tactile features improve learning outcomes, while complex tactile inputs complicate training.</p></details> |  | 论文针对机器人稳定抓握问题，指出当前方法存在局限。通过两种无模型强化学习方法，比较不同触觉与环境设置用于对映抓握。创新点在于系统评估基于力的触觉传感复杂度对抓握学习行为的影响，发现不同触觉特征作用不同。  |

| **[ATLAS Navigator: Active Task-driven LAnguage-embedded Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20386v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of task-oriented navigation in unstructured and unknown environments, where robots must incrementally build and reason on rich, metric-semantic maps in real time. Since tasks may require clarification or re-specification, it is necessary for the information in the map to be rich enough to enable generalization across a wide range of tasks. To effectively execute tasks specified in natural language, we propose a hierarchical representation built on language-embedded Gaussian splatting that enables both sparse semantic planning that lends itself to online operation and dense geometric representation for collision-free navigation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through real-world robot experiments conducted in both cluttered indoor and kilometer-scale outdoor environments, with a competitive ratio of about 60% against privileged baselines.

| **[Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://vulnerable-ai-agents.github.io</p></details> | 该论文研究为何网络人工智能代理比独立语言模型更易受攻击。通过组件级分析等提出更细致评估框架，找出如嵌入用户目标等三个关键因素，强调提升人工智能代理设计安全性与稳健性的迫切性。  |
| **[Multi-Agent Path Planning in Complex Environments using Gaussian Belief Propagation with Global Path Finding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20369v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent path planning is a critical challenge in robotics, requiring agents to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions and optimizing travel efficiency. This work addresses the limitations of existing approaches by combining Gaussian belief propagation with path integration and introducing a novel tracking factor to ensure strict adherence to global paths. The proposed method is tested with two different global path-planning approaches: rapidly exploring random trees and a structured planner, which leverages predefined lane structures to improve coordination. A simulation environment was developed to validate the proposed method across diverse scenarios, each posing unique challenges in navigation and communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the tracking factor reduces path deviation by 28% in single-agent and 16% in multi-agent scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in improving multi-agent coordination, especially when combined with structured global planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by "International Conference on Robotics and Automation" - ICRA 2025</p></details> | 该论文针对多智能体路径规划挑战，结合高斯信念传播与路径积分，引入新跟踪因子，克服现有方法局限。用两种全局路径规划方法测试，开发模拟环境验证，结果表明该因子有效提升多智能体协调，减少路径偏差。  |

This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law.

| **[R2-T2: Re-Routing in Test-Time for Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20395v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large multimodal models (LMMs), the perception of non-language modalities (e.g., visual representations) is usually not on par with the large language models (LLMs)' powerful reasoning capabilities, deterring LMMs' performance on challenging downstream tasks. This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks, without training any base-model parameters.</p></details> |  | 论文针对大型多模态模型中视觉等非语言模态感知能力不足的问题，提出R2-T2方法。该方法在测试时局部优化路由权重向量，有三种策略，能大幅提升模型在多样任务基准上的性能，且无需训练基础模型参数。  |

However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. To address these challenges, we propose PhantomWiki: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. Unlike prior work, PhantomWiki is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. Instead, a new PhantomWiki instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that PhantomWiki datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities.

We develop a mechanism for combining multiple such constraints so that the resulting multiply-constrained model remains a manual bridge that respects all constraints. We also develop a mechanism for training a diffusion model that respects such multiple constraints while also adapting it to match a data distribution. We develop and extend theory demonstrating the mathematical validity of our mechanisms. Additionally, we demonstrate our mechanism in constrained generative modeling tasks, highlighting a particular high-value application in modeling trajectory initializations for path planning and control in autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | 该论文提出基于扩散的受限空间生成建模新框架，引入手动桥扩展可用约束，开发组合多约束及训练模型的机制并论证其数学有效性，还在自动驾驶轨迹初始化建模等任务中展示该机制，具有方法创新及应用价值。  |
| **[Ready-to-React: Online Reaction Policy for Two-Character Interaction Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20370v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the task of generating two-character online interactions. Previously, two main settings existed for two-character interaction generation: (1) generating one's motions based on the counterpart's complete motion sequence, and (2) jointly generating two-character motions based on specific conditions. We argue that these settings fail to model the process of real-life two-character interactions, where humans will react to their counterparts in real time and act as independent individuals. In contrast, we propose an online reaction policy, called Ready-to-React, to generate the next character pose based on past observed motions. Each character has its own reaction policy as its "brain", enabling them to interact like real humans in a streaming manner. Our policy is implemented by incorporating a diffusion head into an auto-regressive model, which can dynamically respond to the counterpart's motions while effectively mitigating the error accumulation throughout the generation process. We conduct comprehensive experiments using the challenging boxing task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines and can generate extended motion sequences. Additionally, we show that our approach can be controlled by sparse signals, making it well-suited for VR and other online interactive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as ICLR 2025 conference paper</p></details> | 该论文针对双角色在线交互生成任务，指出以往设置无法模拟真实交互。提出“Ready-to-React”在线反应策略，通过将扩散头融入自回归模型实现，能实时响应并缓解误差积累，实验表明其优于基线，适用于VR等在线交互环境。  |
| **[R2-T2: Re-Routing in Test-Time for Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20395v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large multimodal models (LMMs), the perception of non-language modalities (e.g., visual representations) is usually not on par with the large language models (LLMs)' powerful reasoning capabilities, deterring LMMs' performance on challenging downstream tasks. This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks, without training any base-model parameters.</p></details> |  | 论文指出大型多模态模型中视觉等模态感知能力弱于语言模型推理能力。提出“测试时重路由（R2-T2）”方法，通过局部优化路由权重向量提升性能，有三种策略，无需训练基础模型参数，显著提高多模态模型在多样任务基准上的表现。  |
| **[Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://vulnerable-ai-agents.github.io</p></details> | 该论文研究为何网络人工智能代理比独立语言模型更易受攻击。通过调查发现其脆弱性源于多方面差异及复杂信号，简单指标难捕捉。提出组件级分析和更细致评估框架，找出三个关键因素，强调增强人工智能代理安全设计的必要性。  |
| **[Multi-Agent Verification: Scaling Test-Time Compute with Multiple Verifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20379v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By utilizing more computational resources at test-time, large language models (LLMs) can improve without additional training. One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.</p></details> |  | 该论文提出通过扩展验证器数量这一测试时计算的新维度，引入多智能体验证（MAV）范式，使用现成的Aspect Verifiers（AVs），介绍了BoN-MAV算法，证明其在提升语言模型性能上比其他方法更具潜力。  |
| **[PhantomWiki: On-Demand Datasets for Reasoning and Retrieval Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20377v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality benchmarks are essential for evaluating reasoning and retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. To address these challenges, we propose PhantomWiki: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. Unlike prior work, PhantomWiki is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. Instead, a new PhantomWiki instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that PhantomWiki datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/kilian-group/phantom-wiki.</p></details> |  | 该论文提出PhantomWiki，是一个生成独特、事实一致的文档语料库及问答对的管道。与以往不同，它按需生成新实例，能分别改变问题难度和语料库大小来评估推理与检索能力，贡献了抗数据泄露的可扩展评估框架。  |
| **[Bridging Legal Knowledge and AI: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Vector Stores, Knowledge Graphs, and Hierarchical Non-negative Matrix Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20364v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Generative AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Vector Stores (VSs), represents a transformative technology applicable to specialized domains such as legal systems, research, recommender systems, cybersecurity, and global security, including proliferation research. This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | 该论文引入整合RAG、VS和KG的生成式AI系统，通过非负矩阵分解构建，用网络抓取技术收集法律文本，弥合传统搜索与语境理解差距，支持法律文档聚类等，提升法律信息检索与AI推理，推动计算法学与AI发展。  |
